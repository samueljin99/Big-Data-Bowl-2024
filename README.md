This is the code for my Big Data Bowl 2024 Project. The submission can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/samueljin99/one-spin-to-win-them-all](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samueljin99/tru-tackling-as-physical-repulsion-at-a-distance).

This project used player tracking data from the 2022 NFL season. In the project, I attempted to model the interplay of tackling in football as a physics-based electrostatics repulsion problem.
I used Python to clean and wrangle the data, and to fit it to my physics model. I used R to create visualizations to complement my analysis.
